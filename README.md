# Fire Effect

This is a demonstration of the fire effect seen in classic demos. There is a version written in
real mode assembly for DOS and two versions written in Javascript for the web (one using the canvas API
and the other using the WebGL API).

## DOS version
Building it requires nasm. If you have nasm installed, go the "dos" directory and use `make` to build it. You can run it in DOSBox.

## Web versions
You can run them by opening "canvas/fire.html" or "webgl/fire.html" in a modern web browser.
