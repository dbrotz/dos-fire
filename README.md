# Fire Effect

This is a demonstration of the fire effect seen in classic demos. There is a version written in
real mode assembly for DOS and a version written in Javascript for the web.

## DOS version
Building it requires nasm. If you have nasm installed, use `make` to build it. You can run it in DOSBox.

## Web version
You can run it by opening "fire.html" in a modern web browser.
